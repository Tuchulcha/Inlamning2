    "##### Experiment Ten:\n",
    "I initially used a dnn and got R2: ~0.46. I later Used XGBoost on the three features that was the recommended scope for the assignment and got around the same score. I've sinced learned that a higher R2 is possible when using all the features. Which begs the question:  \n",
    "Can you make a model that with minimal feature selection and data processing reaches closer to what could be considered a \"good\" R2? ![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "With the right feature selection and XGBoost I got an R2 of 0.876 on this dataset. If I just encode all columns without the feature selection XGBoost gets an R2 of 0.63\n",
    "I have a hypothesis that a sufficiently large neural network model should be able to get 0.876 without choosing columns and dropping certain rows on this dataset.  \n",
    "If I just straight up drop rows with any NaN values and binary encode all data left without the feature selection XGBoost gets an R2 of 0.63.   \n",
    "  \n",
    "I should handle 'Unnamed: 22' 'fulfilled-by' 'promotion-ids' better than that, at least. I Filled in all missing values with least effort. This way I don't have to drop entire rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have included code with the steps of feature engineering in a function. Used for R2 0.876. This way it is easy to see what feature engineering XGBoost needed to reach 0.0876.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the minimally processed dataset without any feature engineering the small transformer regressor reaches a R2 of 0.66 in 15 epoch. That's one block with dimension 64 and one head.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will move a larger model to RAM and let it rip over the night.\n",
    "Set up a learning rate with warm up and decay.\n",
    "Add some dropout since it's going to be running for a long time.\n",
    "At 15 epochs it does not look promising! Way Worse than the small model. But let's give it a night.    \n",
    "A night was 1000 Epochs. The loss is stuck around 8000. I was going for 10000 epochs to see if some magical grocking occures. I don't see R2 during training, only loss. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Forgot to note what the loss was for the small nn with an R2 of 0.66. I was not able to re-create the results I got.* I want tot ake a look at another model with R2 0.66 and see what loss it has for comparison. If MSE for XGBoost is the same as loss, it has 17500 at 0.77 R2. But I don't think they are the same.   \n",
    "  \n",
    "** I recreated the model as I remembered it. It had 1 block of 64 and one head. It had no regularizer and a learning rate of 0.001   \n",
    "I am running the 15 epochs in a copy of the same notebook and getting really bad results. Using the same kernel as the big NN I am training in parallel. A wild theory is that this does something. I will try with another kernel. Did not make a difference. Completely stuck. Maybe I had a lucky intialization of the network that one time.  \n",
    "Made a 3 head, 64 dim, 2 block with a learning rate that goes from 0-0.001 during the first 25%, stays at 1 for the next 50% and then 0.001-0.0005 during the last 25%. 200 epochs.  R2: 0.84, Test-Loss: 12242. I think this nearly proves the hypotesis I had.  \n",
    "Then I started another training run with 20 epochs. The learner function could not handle the learning rate this caused and the loss exploded! I need to tinker with the learning rate function.  \n",
    "This is the big model right now:   \n",
    "Epoch 1445/10000, Loss: 7335.328418975931, LR: 0.0017878392506844893   \n",
    "Does that mean it has a higher R2 than the smaller model with:\n",
    "200 epochs.  R2: 0.84, Test-Loss: 12242   ?\n",
    "I have re-created the learning rate scheduler and trained the 3 head, 64 dim, 2 block tnn and reached R2: 0.84 again. Took around 400 epochs. I trained this fnn with batch_size=128 instead of 64, maybe this is the reason it took more training, or maybe because the second block made it twice as big!  \n",
    "R2 of 0.84 is close to the 0.876 I got with feature engineering. The question now is what 'state of the art' is, or at least 'best in the class' :D  \n",
    "A transformer neural network is probably not a good choice because of resource reasons. But there probably are times when spending compute instead of human resources is preferable. Like if you are one person set to get decent predictions on a lot of different datasets? It's probably possible and less compute to just encode features, do a quick forest, linear regression, xgboost, measure the value of the features and do a feature selection and run xgboost than to do a transformers based nn.\n",

    "2 days later, big model right now:  \n",
    "Epoch 4785/10000, Loss: 5689.417224523966, LR: 0.0013532852778312347  \n",
    "I'm guessing there's no improvement happening, just overfitting. I wish I had some way to know. It's pytorch, no logging and I don't want to stop training because It's using the faulty learning rate function, that only works for a large amount of total epochs. This is all outside the scope of the assignment anyway. I just want to see it through. My guess is that it will have a worse R2 than the smaller model. Maybe around 0.7-0.75.\n",
    "Another 2 days later:  \n",
    "![image-2.png](attachment:image-2.png)\n",
    "0.87, state of the art! The question that remains is, would the R2 be the same had training stopped when the training loss was 10k, like the test loss ended up being?  "
