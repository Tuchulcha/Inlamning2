Reviewing City Names Alphabetically: We're examining city names in the 'ship-city' column letter by letter, starting with 'A' and proceeding through the alphabet. Building a dictionary of corrections. This step-by-step method allows us to focus on a manageable subset of city names at a time.

Identifying and Correcting Patterns: Display an array and look at it for each complete subset of city names (e.g., those starting with 'A'), we're identifying common patterns that need correction or standardization. This includes:

Removing trailing punctuation (like periods). 
Standardizing common misspellings or alternate spellings (like 'adhemdabad' to 'ahmedabad').
Simplifying city names by removing extraneous information like postal codes or numbers appended to the city name (e.g., 'delhi-92' to 'delhi').

Iterative Process: We're listing all the entries for each letter of the alphabet. And adding the corrections to a dictionary. This iterative process ensures a thorough and comprehensive review and correction of the city names in your dataset.

The dictionary is in this format:
    # Corrections for 'A'
    city_corrections = {
        'allhabad': 'allahabad',
        "ahemdabad": "ahmedabad",
        'amravati.': 'amravati',
    }
